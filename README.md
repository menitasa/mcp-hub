# Jamf MCP Server

An MCP server that enables LLMs to interact with Jamf Pro, Protect, and Security Cloud for Apple device management.

## Quick Start

1. **Configure your MCP client** (see [Installation](docs/INSTALLATION.md))
2. **Restart your client** — it automatically starts the server
3. **Ask Claude** for help:
   - "What's the setup status?" → shows which products are configured
   - "How do I configure Jamf Pro?" → step-by-step setup instructions

No credentials required to start — the server runs in onboarding mode until configured.

### Try It Out

Once configured, ask things like:

- "Find all computers running macOS 15"
- "Create a smart group for M3 MacBooks"
- "Show me policies in the Security category"

See [Installation](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for full configuration details.
